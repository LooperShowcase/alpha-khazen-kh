    The multi-year renewal will see New Era caps continue to be worn by McLaren
    Racing’s Formula 1 drivers and staff off the track. In addition, New Era
    branding will appear on the helmets of by the team’s two drivers, Lando
    Norris and Oscar Piastri, during races. McLaren first partnered with New Era
    in 2015 before becoming the Surrey-based Formula 1 team’s official headwear
    provider in 2023. But now, for the first time, New Era will benefit from an
    on-track presence. Chris Koch, New Era CEO, said, “New Era’s roots in the
    sports world run deep. For nearly a century, we’ve provided caps that
    combine style with performance worn both during games and on the sidelines.
    “As McLaren Racing’s official headwear partner, we’ve been able to provide
    that same level of style and authenticity to an iconic Formula 1 team. To
    now see the New Era flag adorn the helmets of McLaren’s F1 roster brings a
    new level of excitement to our longest-running F1 partnership.” Louise
    McEwen, Executive Director, Brand & Marketing, McLaren Racing, added, “We’re
    delighted to extend our partnership with New Era. Our headwear has always
    been a fan-favourite, so it’s fantastic that we will continue to excite our
    fans and launch some bold and iconic ranges to help them celebrate key
    season milestones alongside us.”
