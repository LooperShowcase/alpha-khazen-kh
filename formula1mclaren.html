      The McLaren F1 is a sports car designed and manufactured by British
      automobile manufacturer McLaren Cars and powered by the BMW S70/2 V12
      engine. The original concept was conceived by Gordon Murray, who
      successfully convinced Ron Dennis to back the project and hired car
      designer Peter Stevens to design the exterior and interior of the car. On
      31 March 1998, the XP5 prototype with a modified rev limiter set the
      Guinness World Record for the world's fastest production car, reaching
      240.1 mph (386.4 km/h),[6] surpassing the modified Jaguar XJ220's 217.1
      mph (349 km/h) record from 1993. The car features numerous proprietary
      designs and technologies; it is lighter and has a more streamlined
      structure than many modern sports cars, despite having one seat more than
      most similar sports cars, with the driver's seat located in the centre
      (and slightly forward) of two passengers' seating positions, providing
      driver visibility superior to that of a conventional seating layout. It
      was conceived as an exercise in creating what its designers hoped would be
      considered the ultimate road car. Despite not having been designed as a
      track machine, a modified race car edition of the vehicle won several
      races, including the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, where it faced
      purpose-built prototype race cars. Production began in 1992 and ended in
      1998. In all, 106 cars were manufactured, with some variations in the
      design
